# CROP-PRICE-PREDICTION
This Agriculture crop price prediction model is a machine learning model based on historical data and various influencing factors to predict crop prices. This model aims to improve the accuracy of price forecast, thereby contributing to better planning and risk management in the sector of agriculture.  This project helps farmers, traders and policy makers in making decisions regarding crop yield and distribution. By considering various aspects like crop area, Crop production, GDP, Annual Gross Rate, Inflation, Rainfall, price of the crop in the previous years and Temperature this model predicts the price of the crop per yield based on the above mentioned parameters . Our project aims to improve the accuracy in predicting the price of the crop based on the following parameters. However, in recent years, the emergence of machine learning techniques has offered promising solutions to enhance crop price prediction. This project conducts an extensive review of various machine learning approaches utilized for this purpose, forecasting techniques, ensemble methods, and deep learning strategies. We delve into the unique strengths, limitations, and practical applications of each technique. Moreover, we address the prevalent challenges associated with employing machine learning in crop price prediction, such as data accessibility, feature selection, model interpretability, scalability, and generalization. Additionally, we look ahead to future research avenues and opportunities aimed at refining the accuracy and utility of machine learning models in predicting crop prices.
