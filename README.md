# CROP-PRICE-PREDICTION
This Agriculture crop price prediction model is a machine learning model based on historical data and various influencing factors to predict crop prices. This model aims to improve the accuracy of price forecast, thereby contributing to better planning and risk management in the sector of agriculture. Moreover, we address the prevalent challenges associated with employing machine learning in crop price prediction, such as data accessibility, feature selection, model interpretability, scalability, and generalization. Additionally, we look ahead to future research avenues and opportunities aimed at refining the accuracy and utility of machine learning models in predicting crop prices.
